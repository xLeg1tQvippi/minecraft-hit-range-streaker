2. On running minecraft, you'll see a folder "minescript" created in main folder .minecraft
3. Put the script into folder "minescript" (Not in any other folder inside, just put in minescript, and you are good to go)

1. All minescript scripts activates through "\" (Minecraft basic command usage "/", so it just reverted.)
2. Input the name of the script (If you didn't change the name for simplier usage, it'll be: \pvp_mode)
3. You'll be welcomed by scripts and you can start doing pvp and having fun!
